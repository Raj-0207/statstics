        "1. Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)\n",
        "Qualitative data describes qualities, characteristics, or labels rather than numbers. It helps in categorizing things but doesn’t involve numerical measurements. This type of data is further divided into:\n",

        "Nominal Data: These are simple categories without any particular order. They are used to label or classify things.\n",

        "Examples: Eye color (blue, brown, green), blood type (A, B, AB, O), marital status (single, married, divorced).\n",
        "Ordinal Data: This data has a meaningful order or ranking, but the differences between values are not always equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples: Education level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, Ph.D.), customer satisfaction (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent), economic class (Low, Middle, High).\n",

        "Random sampling is a method used to select individuals from a population in such a way that everyone has an equal chance of being chosen. This helps researchers make accurate conclusions about a larger group without studying every single person.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Why is Random Sampling Important?\n",
        "✅ Avoids Bias – Ensures fairness by giving everyone an equal chance of selection.\n",
        "✅ Saves Time & Money – Studying a smaller, well-chosen group is more efficient than analyzing the entire population.\n",
        "✅ Increases Reliability – A good random sample can accurately represent the whole population.\n",
        "✅ Supports Fair Decision-Making – Used in fields like medicine, business, and politics to make informed choices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Types of Random Sampling\n",
        "Depending on the research, different methods can be used:\n",
        "\n",
        "A. Simple Random Sampling\n",
        "Everyone has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
        "Example: Picking names from a hat or using a random number generator.\n",
        "B. Stratified Random Sampling\n",
        "The population is divided into groups (strata) based on characteristics like age or income, and a random sample is taken from each group.\n",
        "Example: Selecting students from different grades to ensure all grades are represented.\n",
        "C. Systematic Sampling\n",
        "Every nth person from a list is selected.\n",
        "Example: Calling every 5th customer from a store’s contact list for feedback.\n",
        "D. Cluster Sampling\n",
        "The population is divided into clusters (e.g., schools, cities), and entire clusters are chosen randomly.\n",
        "Example: Selecting random schools in a district and surveying all students in those schools.\n",
        "3. How Does Random Sampling Help in Research?\n",
        "🔹 Predicts Population Trends – Helps estimate behaviors or preferences of an entire group.\n",
        "🔹 Tests Hypotheses – Checks if findings from a sample apply to the whole population.\n",
        "🔹 Creates Confidence Intervals – Provides a range that likely includes the true population value.\n",
        "🔹 Reduces Errors – A well-selected sample minimizes mistakes in research conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Challenges of Random Sampling\n",
        "🚨 Sampling Bias – If certain groups are left out, results may not be accurate.\n",
        "🚨 Non-Response Issues – Some people may refuse to participate, affecting results.\n",
        "🚨 Cost & Time Constraints – Ensuring a truly random sample can be difficult and expensive.\n",
        "🚨 Small Sample Risks – A sample that is too small may not reflect the whole population accurately."
